# Competencies

## Seeing the big picture

Seeing the big picture is about having an in-depth understanding and knowledge of how your role fits with and supports organisational objectives and the wider public needs. For all staff, it is about focusing your contribution on the activities which will meet Civil Service goals and deliver the greatest value. For leaders, it is about scanning the political context and taking account of wider impacts to develop long term implementation strategies that maximise opportunities to add value to the citizen and support economic, sustainable growth.

**Be alert to emerging issues and trends which might impact or benefit own and team’s work**

In my role as Multi-media manager in Evelina Hospital School I read an article in the Times Education Supplement (TES) about open source software in schools as a means to save money and make IT budgets go further.

I researched school using open source software as a policy and found one in Cosham near Portsmouth. My line manager and headteacher agreed for me to visit the school and find out more. I had an amazing day and was introduced to their Linux Terminal Servers (LTSP.org). With LTSP one central computer can support multiple user sessions. I felt this could be a great benefit in our own school, stretching our computing resources and leveraging open source software. Over the summer holidays I bought a server on ebay for £80 and followed online tutorials and learnt how to set up my own linux terminal server.

In September I used this in the secondary classroom to deliver ICT workshops with pupils learning graphics on a piece of open source software called Inkscape. The sessions were very successful with pupils providing really positive feedback at the end of sessions. I saw the trend in schools for terminal servers as a powerful way to securely support ‘bring your own device’ which was also an issue I as the Multi-media manager had to consider and advise the senior management team about.

**Develop an understanding of own area’s strategy and how this contributes to Departmental priorities**

At TABLEFLIP we have regular retrospectives. Coming out of these retrospectives there are ever shifting priorities as our strategies evolve. During the string of this year the team decided to emphasis less rapid prototyping and more building for production.

I considered this shift in strategy when talking to a new client on the phone. In our discussion about what features from their list we should focus on in the next sprint I was encouraging Mark to select one we could build properly. Better to have one feature thats fully tested and ready for production, than two features that work but need a little more attention before going live.

I convinced Mark that our experience was pointing us in this direction and he accepted. The sprint focused on one feature which was an interactive filter. We wrote the usual unit tests, but also added some simple component tests using enzyme ([see here](https://github.com/tableflip/mysurvey/blob/master/tests/ui/surveys/surveys.js)). The sense at the end of the sprint was much more satisfying. We finished on time, and avoided the last minute rushing that can happen with tight deadlines. The code we shipped has not caused problems or bugs thus far.

My team members notice that I listen too and adapt to changing priorities. This means they trust me and I feel much closer to them as a team member. This is a strong habit of mine as I see it satisfying the need for a sense of belonging in the workplace.

**Ensure own area/team activities are aligned to Departmental priorities**

TABLEFLIP is a part of a larger community of developers. For the last few years TABLEFLIP have been running the Meteor meetup in London. Offically supported by MDG (Meteor Development Group USA). It has been my responsibility to organise each meetup, securing the venue, arranging the speakers and refreshments.

From talking to the regular attenders I gathered feedback about what talks they'd like to hear at the next meetup. For example when React started to be supported by Meteor people asked for talks on React - so I found a speaker (Judit) to talk about React [Judit's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPek7QF71SA).

These evenings have been a meaningful way for me to make connections with other developers working in the same space using Meteor. I have been inspired and informed by many of the talks at these evenings.


**Actively seek out and share experience to develop understanding and knowledge of own work and of team’s business area**

A client approached us at TABLEFLIP asking us if we could build a chatbot. No-one on the team had built a chatbot or had any experience of them.

I love robots so my interest was aroused and I spent the weekend researching different bot languages and built a simple chatbot. On Monday I shared the bot with the team after our standup. I explained the different frameworks and languages I'd come across and why I choose the one I did. There are lots of ways a chatbot can be a really effective UX tool.

After sharing my experience some weeks later Oli excitedly showed me [habito.com](https://www.habito.com/onboarding/1/purchase) (a mortgage broker that on-boards you with a chatbot). I proposed implementing a chatbot for one of our clients during the following months and integrated a chatbot into 'gitter' (our work messaging platform). In meetings with clients Oli has talked about solving some of their UX issues using a chatbot. My research expanded the teams horizons and was totally in accord with the TABLEFLIP spirit of innovative solutions.

**Seek to understand how the services, activities and strategies in the area work together to create value for the customer/end user**

Each client who approaches TABLEFLIP has different budgets, technical understanding, vision and deadlines. All the things I have learnt about the differnet aspects of delivering software projects work together.

We have a client in Arizona with whome I've been in contact with for nearly a year. My job is to turn his lead into a job. The first briefs were to vague and broad so I advised him to organise his long feature list into a prioritised order. He was going to fund the project himself, I encouraged him to not use his own money (development with TABLEFLIP is expensive) but to find funding. To help him I produced a costing based on his prioritised list. He secured funding for 6 sprints, so then we talked about producing a demo or MVP which he could use to raise more funds. I then produced a more technical proposal for 6 sprints.

Another client came to us with beautiful designs and was ready to go. Everyone is different and I use all my experience of software development to guide them to a good experience.

My sensitivity to the different needs of clients has been commented on in retrospectives by Oli and Alan. They have asked me to be the first point of contact for new clients. I have learnt that no two projects are the same and creating software is a journey of discovery.

## Collaborating and partnering

People skilled in this area are team players. At all levels, it requires working collaboratively, sharing information appropriately and building supportive, trusting and professional relationships with colleagues and a wide range of people inside and outside the Civil Service, whilst having the confidence to challenge assumptions. For leaders, it’s about being approachable, delivering business objectives through creating an inclusive environment, welcoming challenge however uncomfortable.

**Establish relationships with a range of stakeholders to support delivery of business outcomes**

During my time in Evelina Hospital School as the Multi-media manager I was pushing through a project to upgrade the schools internet connection from ADSL to fibre. It was an epic project that took 8 months and involved many different stakeholders.

To deliver the project I developed relationships with:

1) The St Thomas's IT department (the head of networking, and the head of operations)
2) The schools own outsourced IT consultant (first line support ltd)
3) The team at Virgin media (the project managers - there were a few)
4) The head of the hospital estates' 'works', who's office I had to invade 4 times to get to the point of entry for the fibre.
5) The senior management team of the school
6) The teaching staff of the school

Everyone helped in different ways, everyone had a a role to play. When I played the first cat video from Youtube in school delivered with our new fibre connection was quite emotional. This is one of the most meaningful things I have accomplished in my working life. The outcome was super internet upgrade for the teaching staff which benefited them and the pupils attending the school, even today. Internet in a school is as important as water and heating.

My take away was kind and considerate interactions over a long period gather momentum and trust. When people trust you and understand your goals and intentions they will go out of their way to help you.

**Act as a team player, investing time to generate a common focus and genuine team spirit**

During my first year as a developer at TABLEFLIP I suggested that we have a retrospective followed by a summer party that our partners could also attend. My thinking was this would help the TABLEFLIP team get to know each other more fully, which would bring us closer together. The CEO tasked me with organizing the retrospective.

I researched and selected a group activity we could use as a starting exercise for our retrospective. I choose a drawing activity in which there is a mountain and a cannon. Team members had to place themselves in the scene. My experience of reading group dynamics and interpreting abstract exercises revealed some truths that resonate with the group.

Most team members placed themselves flying through the air toward the mountain on a collision course. Alan, our CTO, drew himself above the mountain about to ‘snowboard’ down it. The mountain represents problems or challenges faced by the group. As we talked everyone was infected by Alan’s more positive attitude toward our difficulties.

My reputation as a talented facilitator was galvanised that night. Over the following months the team looked to Alan for encouragement in the face of challenges. Meeting everyone’s partners did not have the effect I thought it might. From that night we never repeated inviting partners to all socialised together again. I realised that knowing about a persons private life is not a reliable way to feel closer to them.

**Actively seek input from a diverse range of people**

My life has been transformed by meetup.com. I had seen the raspberry pi on the bbc 'click' programme and thought that would work well in Evelina School. I looked for some meetups and found nodebots, I had a lovely time and learnt about programming ardunio's using javascript (this is where I installed node.js for the first time). I have attended scores of meetups and see them as a valuable source of new ideas and tooling.

**Readily share resources to support higher priority work, showing pragmatism and support for the shared goals of the organisation**



**Deal with conflict in a prompt, calm and constructive manner**

A client approached us at TABLEFLIP with a brief and budget for 2 sprints. We made it clear that with such a short period of development we would not be able to deliver the whole dream.

When we delivered sprint 2 this client was not happy and insisted that we do more work on the features as they were not quiet what she now wanted. This went on for some time in email exchanges that became more and more distressing.

I talked to Oli and suggested we invite her in for a meeting. She worked in Peckham not far from our offices, I invited her to come in after work and have a cup of tea with us.

I served tea and biscuits, we talked about her spreadsheet of 'bugs' and outstanding issues explaining our position, listening to her. We when through the list and agreed to fix some of the items, and leave other items for a future sprint when she had more money. We compromised because she needed a compelling demo in order to raise more funds.

There were some noticeable changes I made after this conflict situation. Going forwards I always made sure workplans were well documented and there was an email trail with each client that could act as an audit trail. I'd write 'please confirm in an email that you agree to this workplan', so it would always be possible to go back and find what was agreed when and by whom.

**Encourage collaborative team working within own team and across the Department**

In my role at Evelina I worked across all the departments in the school delivering ICT workshops and supporting the staff working with IT in each area.

For Christmas 2010 I worked with the primary and secondary departments to make a [nativity video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtxA5e2dd7M) we had the primary children make puppets and the secondary children film the younger ones. I arranged the recording, prop making and filming with the teachers.

The Christmas service is challenging for staff and pupils in a hospital school. For staff they don't know who will be attending on the day of the service, so is harder to organise an event and give children roles. The video meant lots of the schools pupil's voices could be heard on the day of the service. The staff had something to present, and share which made our relationship with the hospital's chaplaincy team very positive that year.

Collaborating across the school meant I was able to produce something really different that year.

## Changing and improving

People who are effective in this area take initiative, are innovative and seek out opportunities to create effective change. For all staff, it’s about learning from what has worked as well as what has not,
being open to change and improvement, and working in ‘smarter’, more focused ways. For leaders, this is about creating and encouraging a culture of innovation and allowing people to consider and take informed decisions. Doing this well means continuously seeking out ways to improve policy implementation and build a leaner, more  exible and responsive Civil Service. It also means making use of alternative delivery models including digital and shared service approaches wherever possible.


**Find ways to improve systems and structures to deliver with more streamlined resources**

When I joined Evelina Hospital School my job was consumed by data entry. The school had purchased a pupil data system that was designed to be used by a mainstream school. Evelina was a hospital school, with a large transient population. It was very time consuming and inefficient adding and removing pupils each week. Much of the softwares tools and features were not used and things that we would have found helpful were not there.

In a meeting with my line manager I suggested that with the money we spent on the software over 2 years, we could use the money to pay for a developer to create a bespoke system. I was sent off to do some research into the software systems of the other large hospital schools (Chelsea and Westminster, Great Ormond Street and the Royal Free). I talked to the head of schools IT in Southwark council then reported my findings with a recommendation to commission our own pupil data software.

This brought about amazing outcomes. The time spent entering data dropped from 3 working days to 1 working day. That freed up my time to start delivering ICT workshops in the classroom. We saved money on the third year as we no longer had to pay every year for the software. With the new system analysis of data soared to giving the Headteacher upto date information on pupil numbers - very important for funding. I was exposed for the first time to software development.

**Regularly review procedures or systems with teams to identify improvements and simplify processes and decision making**

TABLEFLIP are really good at reviewing working processes. We have retrospectives once a month and evaluate how we are working with clients and together.

When I joined TABLEFLIP I started a pin board with all our jobs arranged in columns. We still have this today - although the columns have changed. Originally I had things organised into 'leads', 'current jobs', 'scheduled jobs'. Now we just have jobs in a team members column 'Bernard', 'Oli' and 'Alan'. This was because correspondence was slipping through the net. We would all receive an email from a client, but could all assume the others would deal with it. We changed this so each person deals with responding to particular clients. That way things don't get missed.

After a conflict situation with a client I leant from this and always created audit trails in email correspondence making it clear what has been agreed, for when by whom.

I feel more in control of the work that I'm doing and feel it is easier to concentrate.

**Be prepared to take managed risks, ensuring these are planned and their impact assessed**

After 5 years at Evelina Hospital School all I wanted to do each day at work was write code, but I had other responsibilities which meant I couldn't. I was fortunate to suddenly have access to funds due to an inheritance. I had found out about Makers Academy and the 12 week course they offer for £8,000. I now had £8,000.

I applied for the course, and after an interview secured a place. I budgeted a runway of 4 months, 3 for the course and 1 to find a job. I took a risk and handed in my resignation.

I considered the impact on the school of my decision to leave. I gave many months notice and choose to join the September cohort, to coincide with the academic year. I helped write the job spec for my position and interviewed with my line manager and Headteacher the new candidate. I visited all the people in the hospital I'd made friends with during the fibre project and let them know I was going and I'd introduce the new person.

It was a calculated risk. I felt that I would be able to find a job as a developer if I had a little more formal training. My risk paid off I was able to join TABLEFLIP in January within my runway.

## Making effective decisions

Effectiveness in this area is about using sound judgement, evidence and knowledge to arrive at accurate, expert and professional decisions and advice. For all staff its about being careful and thoughtful about the use and protection of government and public information to ensure it is handled securely and with care. For leaders, its about reaching evidence based strategies, evaluating options, impacts, risks and solutions and creating a security culture around the handling of information. They will aim to maximise return while minimising risk and balancing a range of considerations to provide sustainable outcomes.
