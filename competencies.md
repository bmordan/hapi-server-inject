# Competencies

## Seeing the big picture

Seeing the big picture is about having an in-depth understanding and knowledge of how your role fits with and supports organisational objectives and the wider public needs. For all staff, it is about focusing your contribution on the activities which will meet Civil Service goals and deliver the greatest value. For leaders, it is about scanning the political context and taking account of wider impacts to develop long term implementation strategies that maximise opportunities to add value to the citizen and support economic, sustainable growth.

**Be alert to emerging issues and trends which might impact or benefit own and team’s work**

In my role as Multi-media manager in Evelina Hospital School I read an article in the Times Education Supplement (TES) about open source software in schools.

I researched open source schools and found one in Cosham near Portsmouth. My line manager and headteacher agreed for me to visit the school and find out more. I had an amazing day and was introduced to their Linux Terminal Servers (LTSP.org). With LTSP one central computer can support multiple user sessions. I felt this could be a great benefit in our own school, stretching our computing resources and leveraging open source software in schools. Over the summer holidays I bought a server on ebay for £80 and followed online tutorials and learnt how to set up my own linux terminal server.

In September I used this in the secondary classroom to deliver ICT workshops with pupils learning graphics on a piece of open source software called Inkscape. The sessions were very successful with pupils providing really positive feedback at the end of sessions. Other outcomes were recognising the trend in schools for terminal servers is a powerful way to securely support ‘bring your own device’ which was also an issue I as the Multi-media manager had to consider and advise the senior management team about.

**Develop an understanding of own area’s strategy and how this contributes to Departmental priorities**
**Ensure own area/team activities are aligned to Departmental priorities**
**Actively seek out and share experience to develop understanding and knowledge of own work and of team’s business area**

A client approached us at TABLEFLIP asking us if we could build a chatbot. Noone on the team had built a chatbot or had any experience of building them.

My interest was aroused and I spent the weekend researching different bot languages and built a simple chatbot. On Monday I shared the bot with the team after our standup. I explained the different frameworks and languages I'd come across and why I choose the one I did. There are lots of ways a chatbot can be a really effective tool.

After sharing my experience, Oli excitedly showed me [habito.com](https://www.habito.com/onboarding/1/purchase). I proposed implementing a chatbot for one of our clients during the following months and integrated a chatbot into 'gitter' (our work messaging platform). In meetings with clients we have talked about solving some of there problems using chatbots. My research expanded the teams horizons.

**Seek to understand how the services, activities and strategies in the area work together to create value for the customer/end user**

## Collaborating and partnering

People skilled in this area are team players. At all levels, it requires working collaboratively, sharing information appropriately and building supportive, trusting and professional relationships with colleagues and a wide range of people inside and outside the Civil Service, whilst having the confidence to challenge assumptions. For leaders, it’s about being approachable, delivering business objectives through creating an inclusive environment, welcoming challenge however uncomfortable.

**Establish relationships with a range of stakeholders to support delivery of business outcomes**

During my time in Evelina Hospital School as the Multi-media manager I was pushing through a project to upgrade the schools internet connection from ADSL to fibre. It was an epic project that took 8 months and involved many different stakeholders.

To deliver the project I developed relationships with:

1) The St Thomas's IT department (the head of networking, and the head of operations)
2) The schools own outsourced IT consultant (first line support ltd)
3) The team at Virgin media (the project managers - there were a few)
4) The head of the hospital estates' 'works', who's office I had to invade 4 times to get to the point of entry for the fibre.
5) The senior management team of the school
6) The teaching staff of the school

Everyone helped in different ways, everyone had a a role to play. When I played the first cat video from Youtube in school delivered with our new fibre connection was quite emotional. This is one of the most meaningful things I have accomplished in my working life. The outcome was super internet upgrade for the teaching staff which benefited them and the pupils attending the school, even today. Internet in a school is as important as water and heating.

My take away was kind and considerate interactions over a long period gather momentum and trust. When people trust you and understand your goals and intentions they will go out of their way to help you.

**Act as a team player, investing time to generate a common focus and genuine team spirit**

During my first year as a developer at TABLEFLIP I suggested that we have a retrospective followed by a summer party that our partners could also attend. My thinking was this would help the TABLEFLIP team get to know each other more fully, which would bring us closer together. The CEO tasked me with organizing the retrospective.

I researched and selected a group activity we could use as a starting exercise for our retrospective. I choose a drawing activity in which there is a mountain and a cannon. Team members had to place themselves in the scene. My experience of reading group dynamics and interpreting abstract exercises revealed some truths that resonate with the group.

Most team members placed themselves flying through the air toward the mountain on a collision course. Alan, our CTO, drew himself above the mountain about to ‘snowboard’ down it. The mountain represents problems or challenges faced by the group. As we talked everyone was infected by Alan’s more positive attitude toward our difficulties.

My reputation as a talented facilitator was galvanised that night. Over the following months the team looked to Alan for encouragement in the face of challenges. Meeting everyone’s partners did not have the effect I thought it might. From that night we never repeated inviting partners to all socialised together again. I realised that knowing about a persons private life is not a reliable way to feel closer to them.

**Actively seek input from a diverse range of people**
**Readily share resources to support higher priority work, showing pragmatism and support for the shared goals of the organisation**

**Deal with conflict in a prompt, calm and constructive manner**

A client approached us at TABLEFLIP with a brief and budget for 2 sprints. We made it clear that with such a short period of development we would not be able to deliver the whole dream.

When we delivered sprint 2 this client was not happy and insisted that we do more work on the features as they were not quiet what she now wanted. This went on for some time.

I found the email correspondence that followed distressing. In my emails I went to great lengths to keep any emotional heat out of my replies. This I often did by leaving my email for an hour before sending, then re-reading them and checking I was being straight and factual. I found on the phone things calmed down alot and we were able to come to a compromise with fixes and enhancements.

**Encourage collaborative team working within own team and across the Department**

In my role at Evelina I worked across all the departments in the school delivering ICT workshops and supporting the staff working with IT in each area.

For Christmas 2010 I worked with the primary and secondary departments to make a [nativity video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtxA5e2dd7M) we had the primary children make puppets and the secondary children film the younger ones. I arranged the recording, prop making and filming with the teachers.

The Christmas service is challenging for staff and pupils in a hospital school. For staff they don't know who will be attending on the day of the service, so is harder to organise an event and give children roles. The video meant lots of the schools pupil's voices could be heard on the day of the service. The staff had something to present, and share which made our relationship with the hospital's chaplaincy team very positive that year.

Collaborating across the school meant I was able to produce something really different that year.

## Changing and improving

People who are effective in this area take initiative, are innovative and seek out opportunities to create effective change. For all staff, it’s about learning from what has worked as well as what has not,
being open to change and improvement, and working in ‘smarter’, more focused ways. For leaders, this is about creating and encouraging a culture of innovation and allowing people to consider and take informed decisions. Doing this well means continuously seeking out ways to improve policy implementation and build a leaner, more  exible and responsive Civil Service. It also means making use of alternative delivery models including digital and shared service approaches wherever possible.


**Find ways to improve systems and structures to deliver with more streamlined resources**

When I joined Evelina Hospital School my job was consumed by data entry. The school had purchased a pupil data system that was designed to be used by a mainstream school. Evelina was a hospital school, with a large transient population. It was very time consuming and inefficient adding and removing pupils each week. Much of the softwares tools and features were not used and things that we would have found helpful were not there.

In a meeting with my line manager I suggested that with the money we spent on the software over 2 years, we could use the money to pay for a developer to create a bespoke system. I was sent off to do some research into the software systems of the other large hospital schools (Chelsea and Westminster, Great Ormond Street and the Royal Free). I talked to the head of schools IT in Southwark council then reported my findings with a recommendation to commission our own pupil data software.

This brought about amazing outcomes. The time spent entering data dropped from 3 working days to 1 working day. That freed up my time to start delivering ICT workshops in the classroom. We saved money on the third year as we no longer had to pay every year for the software. With the new system analysis of data soared to giving the Headteacher upto date information on pupil numbers - very important for funding. I was exposed for the first time to software development.

**Regularly review procedures or systems with teams to identify improvements and simplify processes and decision making**

TABLEFLIP are really good at reviewing working processes. We have retrospectives once a month and talk about how we are working with clients.

When I joined TABLEFLIP I started a pin board with all our jobs arranged in columns. We still have this today - although the columns have changed. Originally I had things organised into 'leads', 'current jobs', 'scheduled jobs'. Now we just have jobs in a team members column. We found

**Be prepared to take managed risks, ensuring these are planned and their impact assessed**

After 5 years at Evelina Hospital School all I wanted to do each day at work was write code, but I had other responsibilities which meant I couldn't. I was fortunate to suddenly have access to funds due to an inheritance. I had found out about Makers Academy and the 12 week course they offer for £8,000. I now had £8,000.

I applied for the course, and after an interview secured a place. I budgeted a runway of 4 months, 3 for the course and 1 to find a job. I took a risk and handed in my resignation.

I considered the impact on the school of my decision to leave. I gave many months notice and choose to join the September cohort, to coincide with the academic year. I helped write the job spec for my position and interviewed with my line manager and Headteacher the new candidate. I visited all the people in the hospital I'd made friends with during the fibre project and let them know I was going and I'd introduce the new person.

It was a calculated risk. I felt that I would be able to find a job as a developer if I had a little more formal training. My risk paid off I was able to join TABLEFLIP in January within my runway.

**Actively encourage ideas from a wide range of sources and stakeholders and use these to inform own thinking**
**Be willing to meet the challenges of difficult or complex changes, encouraging and supporting others to do the same**
**Prepare for and respond appropriately to the range of possible effects that change may have on own role/team**

## Making effective decisions

Effectiveness in this area is about using sound judgement, evidence and knowledge to arrive at accurate, expert and professional decisions and advice. For all staff its about being careful and thoughtful about the use and protection of government and public information to ensure it is handled securely and with care. For leaders, its about reaching evidence based strategies, evaluating options, impacts, risks and solutions and creating a security culture around the handling of information. They will aim to maximise return while minimising risk and balancing a range of considerations to provide sustainable outcomes.
